## Why use QuoteKeeper?

Imagine you're in a history class with your eccentric teacher, and they say something funny that you'd like to save for later. Instead of wasting 45 seconds opening a new file and filling out the details, QuoteKeeper allows you to jot it down instantly and keep it neatly organized in a JSON file.
